# Course Shop App

  This application is my pet project. Over the course of its implementation, I gained a lot of practical skills using various features of the Node.js platform, as well as the Express.js framework. 

## Description

  The following topics were practiced in this project: 
    - HTML templates(Handlebars engine)
    - MongoDB, Mongoose object modeling tool
    - Session and authorization
    - Email messaging
    - Form validations(server side)
    - Deploying(Heroku)
    
## Installation
  Download the repository -> open the folder with source code -> run command ```npm install``` then ```npm run dev``` -> open your browser at local localhost:3000. Any changes at your discretion :)
  The working version of the project can be viewed at the link below:
